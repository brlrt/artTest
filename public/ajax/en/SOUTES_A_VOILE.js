  txt: "Directly accessible via a hatch on the foredeck, this area of the yacht is used to store additional fore sails such as the spinnaker or storm jib. The locker contains 4 to 5 sails each weighing between 50 and 60 kg. They are stacked, i.e. moved to the other side, when the boat changes tack, in order to offset the heel of the boat.",
