  txt: "On large racing yachts, the mast measures between 27 and 29 m high. The boat is in fact much higher than it is long! Despite its impressive size, the mast is quite light as it is made of carbon. Its shape known as a “wing mast”, and the way it is attached to a ball joint on the deck, enables it to turn in line with the sail. The mast and its attachments (shrouds, stays and backstays) are subjected to extreme forces during races and dismasting is frequent. Incidents, such as a blocked halyard for example, can also force the skipper to climb to the top of the mast... a chore little appreciated by some!",
