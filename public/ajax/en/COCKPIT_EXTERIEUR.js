  txt: "The outer cockpit of a 60-foot IMOCA yacht like this one is located at the stern of the boat and designed so that the skipper sailing single-handed has everything to hand: wheels to steer, ropes and winches to set the sails, navigation instruments, etc. To enhance the comfort and safety for the skipper, sometimes the cockpit is protected by a spray hood sometimes sliding which can be adapted to the sailing conditions.",
