  txt: "The bowsprit is a spar, i.e. a piece of the rigging, long and rigid, placed at the prow of the boat. It is not included in the length of the boat but it must not exceed 6 feet, or 1.829 m long. It is used to attach very large sails at the front of the boat such as the spinnaker or gennaker.",
