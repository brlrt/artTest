  txt: "Most large monohull racing yachts today are fitted with lifting daggerboards. They are used in addition to the canting keel. When the keel is lifted on one side or other of the boat, it no longer acts to prevent sideways drift. So, the daggerboard on the other side needs to be lowered for the boat to maintain its heading without drifting sideways.",
