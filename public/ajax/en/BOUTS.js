  txt: "The number of lines (ropes) on a boat is impressive. On large yachts designed for single-handed racing, all the lines run back to the cockpit so that the skipper can trim the sails safely. A major manoeuver however such as changing tacks can rapidly transform the cockpit into a battlefield! All of the ropes then have to be carefully tidied away so as not to get feet caught in them!",
