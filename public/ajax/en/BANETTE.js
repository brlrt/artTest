  txt: "The bunk is the sailor’s bed while racing. There is one either side of the inner cockpit, enabling the skipper to select the bunk depending on the heel. Today sometimes, it is replaced by large cushions on which the sailors can sleep comfortably and fully dressed. There is no heating in the boat and sailors always need to be ready to jump out for an emergency manoeuver!",
