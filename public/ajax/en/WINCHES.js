  title: "Winches",
  txt: "Wind pressure, weight of sails, these are elements that make manoeuvres on board large yachts difficult. Winches are absolutely essential: by acting as a hoist, like the gears on a bicycle that help the cyclist to go up hill, it multiplies the efforts needed to hoist or set the sails.  Most winches are operated by means of a horizontal lever known as a “windmill”, and on large racing yachts they are sometimes connected to a column called a “coffee grinder” where two crew members can winch face to face. Winching remains a very physical activity nonetheless: it takes almost half an hour to hoist a mainsail single-handedly!",
