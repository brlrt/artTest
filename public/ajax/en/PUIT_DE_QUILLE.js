  txt: "Located under the hull of the boat, the keel box is a compartment in which the keel is inserted when not in use (i.e. when it is raised). The canting keel moves thanks to a hydraulic ram located in one of the boat compartments. The sailor can access this directly to check the keel is in good working order and properly fixed, especially following a collision with a UFO (Unidentified Floating Object) or a marine mammal.",
