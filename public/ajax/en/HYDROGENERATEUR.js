  txt: "The hydrogenerator is located at the back of the boat in the water, and uses the current generated by the movement of the yacht to convert to electricity. It allows the yacht’s batteries to be charged so the boat can be sailed safely. These renewable energy devices or “green technologies” mean the boat can be almost entirely autonomous, while at the same time being lighter than a traditional diesel engine. Developed since 2008, they have been widely adopted by sailors: most of the boats in the Vendée Globe are equipped today.",
