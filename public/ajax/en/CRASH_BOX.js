  txt: "The crash-box is the yacht’s bumper. This part at the front of the yacht, made of foam, attenuates the impact in the event of a collision with a UFO (unidentified floating object). In the event of a violent impact, it can even be torn off! The watertight bulkheads will prevent the water from spreading into the boat.",
